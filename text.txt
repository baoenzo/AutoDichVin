That job, can I help you with something?
Since it is a sedentary job, you can't help but have stiff shoulders.
We were almost out of tea for our visitors, so I bought some more!
I'd like to ask you a few questions about that case...
Thank you for everything.
Regarding your recent request...
Lately, I feel as if my body is not getting tired...
I'm fine, thank you for your concern.
I understand. But I can't help you with this one.
Thanks. Please turn the receipts over to Accounting.
Thank you. Please turn in your receipts to Accounting.
In that case, I'll give you the information next time.
If you are interested, I will provide you with the materials next time.
It's my job, so thanking me is fine. But... I don't feel bad about the compliment.
Yes, that's all I have to say about that one.
Why don't you just rest?
I think you just have to rest your body anyway.
What is going on with your example?
I'm looking to purchase a new notepad, any suggestions?
Oh, by the way, I finished the paperwork you asked me to do.
Was your call okay the other day?
It makes me feel good about my job.
For those with a closing date, next month is no problem.
I don't enjoy my job...
If you are there, we've already done that as of last week.
If so, how about the notepad I am using now? It's easy to use.
Thanks for your help. I'll check the contents later.
Thanks for your time. I'll check the contents later.
Thanks for your time. I'll check the contents later.
It was all right. I explained in detail and they understood.
I appreciate you saying so.
I appreciate you saying so.
I understand. I'll turn it in for next month.
I don't know what you're talking about. You're either still going to work hard or quit your job.
Even if you say that... I think you have to either do your best anyway, or quit for good!
How is your work going?
Are there any difficulties in your current job?
It's an example case, but I just wanted to check a few things...
I'm having a bit of trouble... With the example job...
If you need any missing equipment, just ask.
New products for example, please deliver on time!
That job is hard for me...
Steady, I think. Well, I have to admit that it's no different than usual.
No, I'm fine. If you need anything, I'll be able to count on you.
This needs to be confirmed by the other side, so we'll handle it over here.
This needs to be confirmed by the other party, so we'll take care of it.
That job is certainly complicated. I'll get it straightened out.
It's okay. I'm checking the list of supplies.
Yes, we always deliver on time!
That's a very weak attitude. Well, maybe you should just throw it out.
Then don't push it, just say no.
I recommend that store near my office, they had a good selection.
I have a restaurant where I enjoy good international food and I go there often!
Do you like watching sports?
I'm wondering about starting a new hobby... What do you think?
You are playing the game on your phone, is it interesting?
Have you had any hobbies since you were a child?
I mean... Is there a way to always win at a casino?
Heh, I see. I'll go there next time.
Wow, that's nice, I'd like to go there too.
I love it, especially baseball.
I love it, especially baseball.
I love it, especially baseball.
I think it's good to try everything.
I think it's interesting. And it's a good way to pass the time.
I've always loved soccer. I still watch a lot.
If you don't stop until you win, you'll win.
If you don't stop until you win, you'll never win.
I know I have to stop, but when I get stressed I end up buying a lot of clothes and shoes...
Have you been watching that drama that's been getting a lot of attention? It's getting more and more interesting.
A delicious-looking restaurant was opened near my office!
I like karaoke quite a bit.
Do you ever spend your day off in bed and just laze around?
Do you go to a gym?
Is there any easy way to make money...
Ah... I understand. I, too, buy things on impulse online...
Yes, I do watch it. I look forward to it every week too.
I'm glad to hear that. I'll put it on my lunch list.
That would be great to hear. I'll put it on my lunch list.
That sounds great. I'll put it on my lunch list.
I like karaoke, too. It feels good to sing.
It happens sometimes... Well, it's important to get a good rest, so I don't think it's a bad idea to be lazy!
I haven't been going through it. It's hard to keep exercising.
It's gambling, gambling. If you win, you're a millionaire.
I think gambling is the best way to do that.
I enjoy sweets from convenience stores and always check to see if there are any new products!
Speaking of which, have you visited the restaurant you mentioned earlier that you were interested in?
Is there anything you are into these days?
What are some ways to relieve stress?
Do you listen to music often?
I made a big purchase not too long ago... And I've been trying to save money lately.
I'm not sure if I want to change jobs these days...
I understand. I wander by on my way home from work too.
I went there. The store was well stocked and lived up to its reputation.
Cooking and walking.
Cooking and walking.
Cooking and walking.
After all, it is alcohol. It makes me feel happy when I drink it.
I'm listening. But I haven't kept up with the latest trends...
That's a good thing. Saving money is important.
Booze and cigarettes. It's refreshing.
Alcohol and cigarettes. It's refreshing.
Would you like to go to a restaurant with us?
Great, I'll join you.
I'm sorry... I can't go out with you.
I'm a little inconvenient... Sorry.

Okay, I'll go out with you.

Fine, I'll go out with you.
I ain't in the mood for this.
If you like, why don't you go to the restaurant?
All right, let's go.
Sorry...
Sorry, it's a little difficult.
All right, I'll go with you.
Sorry, but you'll have to invite me back another time.
All right, I'll go with you.
Sorry, please invite me back another time.
All right, I'll join you.
Can we do it another time?
Sorry, we'll do it another time.
All right, let's go.
I don't want to do this. I'm too tired.
Would you like to go to a cafe if you like?
Would you like to have a cup of tea at a cafe?
Why don't we go to the park for a while?
Why not take a walk in the park?
Could you please come this way now?
Thank you very much. We'll be waiting for you.
... Difficult, I understand.
We would like you to come here. Is your time OK?
Please come with care.
I must have been in the wrong place at the wrong time... I understand.
I would like to ask you a few questions...
I'm sorry, I'd like to confirm something...
I would like to meet with you now, is that okay?
Thank you very much. I'll be on my way soon.
May I have a moment?
Yes, what is it?
Yes, what's wrong?
What's wrong?
Is something wrong?
How can I help you?
What is it?
I'm sorry... A little better?
You wanted to see me?
Can I help you?
What is it?
Yes, what is it?
Yes, what is it?
What's wrong?
Now... Are you okay?
Yes, it's okay.
I'm sorry... No thanks.
Yes, I'm fine.
I don't care.
No, you can't.
Yeah, it's okay.
... Sorry.
I'm sorry, but I can't.
... I'm sorry.
Yeah, man.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Do you have time to?
Yes, no problem.
Sorry, I must decline.
Yes, no problem.
Um... Sorry.
No problem.
I'm sorry, but I can't go out with you.
No problem.

I can't go out with you.
Would you like to have a long talk with me?
Yes, okay.
I'm not in the mood... Sorry.
I'm not really in the mood to chat... Sorry.
Yeah, no problem.
We'll talk about it another time.

I'm not in the mood... Sorry.
I'm kind of... Sorry, right now.
Yeah, no problem.
I'm a little... Sorry about that right now.
I'm not really in the mood to talk.
I would like to talk with you a lot.
Why don't you and I go to a hotel?
Hehe... Yes, okay.
I'm just not in the mood for that... Sorry.
... Yes, that's fine.
I'm not in the mood for that... Sorry.
Sure, OK.
I'd better not.
Okay, I'll go out with you.
Sorry, I can't keep you company.
... Yeah, okay.
Sorry, no thanks.
... I understand.
I'll pass...
Fine, I'll go out with you.
Sorry, but I'm not going out with you.
Why don't you take a break at the hotel?
... Yeah, let's go.
It's a little... Difficult.
I just... Can't go.
Okay, why don't we go out?
I'll pass.
Okay, I'll go with you.
That's a little... Sorry.
... Okay, I'll go with you.
Sorry...
... Yes, I'm with you.
All right, I'll go with you.
I'm not in the mood for this.
... Would you two like to go to the bathroom?
Hey, can you follow me to the bathroom?
What? !
Now I can't...
Whoa!
Nah!
No, I can't go out with you...
Whoa!
I'll have to ask you to consider the timing...
This is not the right time...
... Think about the timing.
Whoa!
What are you talking about at this point in time? Are you an idiot?
I have a favor to ask... May I?
Sorry, I must decline.
I would like to ask you a few questions...
I am sorry, but I must decline.
Could you please come to the restroom?
Well, I'll be waiting for you.
... Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
I can help you with your next project, if you want me to.
Sitting all the time makes you stiff!
I've put all the material together properly from the other day.
What happened to the files that were on the back shelf?
Thank you for your help the other day.
Did you find any deficiencies in the recent invoice?
It's hard to rest my body...
No problem. Thank you for your concern.
It's going to be a pain, especially in the buttocks.
Thanks. I'll check it out next time.
Thank you very much. I'll check it out next time.
I moved it to the warehouse when I organized it the other day.
Never mind. I was just passing by.
I didn't have any problems.
Hmmm. I sleep great every day.
In that case, I think you should take a paid holiday.
Was I in charge of that case?
I need to replace that part.
I've bought more fine tea cakes for our visitors!
Did you have a good meeting the other day?
Thank you for always cleaning up.
I had no problem with the specifications you gave me the other day.
It's been a busy day here...
Yes, I think you were in charge.
You should replace it with an up-to-date one if possible.
Thanks for the help. Those tea cakes are well received.
Thank you for your help. Those tea cakes are very popular.
It's okay. The material was well done, so it was not a problem!
Thank you. But this is my job.
That's good to know. I will bring you another one when I have a new one.
Play for a change. It's fun.
You should go play somewhere for a change.
How is your work going in your example?
If you have any questions about your work, please feel free to ask me anything.
What were the details of this deal?
I'm having a hard time understanding what the document I got the other day... Means.
If you need to restock your supplies, please let me know anytime.
Orders placed during this time should be sent directly to the warehouse
I had a tough job coming my way...
It's okay. There's no problem.
Thank you very much. You can count on me if you ever need anything.
I'll pass the material around next time. Please look it over.
I'll pass the material around next time, so please look it over.
I'll annotate for clarity.
Thanks for the help. I'll check the equipment list next time.
I understand. The number should be the same as last time, right?
Sobriety Sobriety. It's the guy who pushed it.
In that case, I think you should just skim it off as you see fit.
I saw a movie the other night that was really good.
I watch that drama with that actor every week without fail.
Which do you prefer, Japanese or Western food?
I'm thinking of going solo camping next time.
Do you like to read books?
Have you taken up any new hobbies recently?
How can I get money for fun?
I saw that movie too. It was a very good movie.
I like that actor too. I can't help but check them out.
I'm starting to like Japanese food these days.
I'm getting to like Japanese food these days.
I like Japanese food these days.
Solo camping is great. I think it's fun from the moment you get your gear together.
I like it. I'm learning things that I'm reminded of again.
Swimming. I just started so I can't swim that well, but it's fun!
There is no such thing except gambling.
After all, it's gambling. It's easy to win when you gamble.
When I'm on vacation, I always end up visiting sweets shops, which is a bit of a problem for me.
That sweet that's so popular right now was sold at a nearby store!
Did you know that there is a new cafe in front of the station?
Do you like animals? I like all animals quite well.
Do you ever stay up late at night because you get caught up in your phone?
Is there anything you are into?
I'd love to know if you have any gambling winning strategies.
If you eat too much just because it tastes good, you'll worry about your figure.
Really? I've been wanting to try it, I'll go there next time.
I know, but I haven't been there yet.
I know, but I haven't been there yet.
I know. But I haven't been there yet.
I like animals too. I used to have a dog and a cat at my parents' house.
It happens sometimes. I try to be careful, but...
Recently, it's tropical fish. I've started keeping new ones.
It's easy. Just keep going until you win.
It's easy. Just keep going until you win.
I'm addicted to character key chains and collect many of them.
How was the atmosphere at that restaurant you were talking about the other day?
Do you have any movie recommendations?
Should I learn English conversation or something like that?
Do you like sweets?
Actually... I've been working on my diet a bit.
Is my life as it should be?
Collecting pretty things sounds fun and wonderful!
It was a very nice store. I think I will be going back for a while.
If you're into horror, I have a few recommendations for you.
If you're into horror, I have a few recommendations for you.
English is useful in many ways, so I think it's good to learn it!
If anything, I'm not a fan of sweets.
Forced dieting, on the contrary, is bad for you.
I don't know. I don't know, man.
If you ask me... I don't know.
Would you two like to go to a restaurant?
If you would like, we can go to a restaurant.
How about we both go to a cafe?
Would you like to have tea at a cafe with us?
Why don't you go to the park for a bit?
Would you like to take a walk with us in the park?
Well... Okay.
I would like to ask you to come over here, if you have a minute.
Well... That's too bad.
Excuse me, may I confirm this...
I would like to meet with you now... Is that okay?
May I have a word?
Well, I'm sorry...
Is that... Is your time okay?
Could you please join us at... For a moment?
Why don't we have a nice talk?
I would like to talk to you about a lot of things... Is that OK?
Would you like to go to a hotel... Together?
I have a small favor to ask...
May I have a moment of your time?
... You can't come.
Have you ever thought about working in another clinic or hospital?
Nurses are all about smiling, right?
Speaking of which, when is the next study group meeting?
Hope you get well soon.
Do you have any problems?
I heard that you have a quota for your work... Isn't that hard?
I've been feeling a lot of anxiety lately...
Well... So far, I haven't thought about it.
Yes, I do. But I'm not very good at it.
Well, let's do it the week after next.
Well... Let's do it the week after next or so.
Yes, well... We'll make arrangements to do it the week after next or so.
Yes, I am. Thank you for your concern.
Yes, I am. Thank you for your attention.
No, we're good for now.
No, we're good for now.
In my case, it is easier to work hard if there is a quota. I can work hard with that as my goal.
In my case, it is easier to work hard if there is a quota. I can work hard with that as my goal.
... Sleep it off and we'll figure it out.
Get a good night's sleep and you'll be fine.
I quite like talking to patients.
I would like to learn from your work ethic.
Thanks for all your hard work.
If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to tell us.
Hehe... Glad to hear you'll be out of the hospital soon!
As a salesperson, communication is an important part of your job!
I'm just so tired from all the work I've been doing...
Hehe... It's fun, isn't it? I'm with you.
Yes, sir? Thank you.
What's wrong with you all of a sudden? Well, I don't feel bad about being labored over. Thank you.
Thank you very much. You, too, are always a pleasure to work with.
Yes, feel free to rely on me.
Yes, I will rely on you then.
Yes, thanks to you. Really, thank you for everything.
Yes, thanks to you. Thank you so much for everything.
Yes, we do. Because we need to talk a lot to meet the needs of our customers.
Yes, we do. We need to talk a lot to meet the needs of our customers.
Yes, we do. We have to talk a lot to meet the needs of our customers.
You just don't get enough sleep.
Sleep warm and you'll be fine.
Nursing is a rewarding job, don't you think?
Do you have any problems in your business?
Are you tired from work?
Are you taking your medications regularly?
Please don't hesitate to tell us anything.
Insurance is a big part of our customers' lives, and it sounds like a very rewarding job!
I'm having a hard time... Feeling confident in my job.
Yes, I do. So, in my own way, but I do my best every day!
There's nothing you don't know, so you'll be fine.
Haha, it's okay. If the doctor isn't fine, the patient will be worried.
I'm fine. If I'm not well, my patients get anxious.
I think it's okay. If I look gloomy, my patients will be anxious.
Don't worry, I remember to take it.
Yes, I am. I will rely on you if I need anything.
Yes, I will. I will rely on you in case of any problems.
Yes, I do. When our customers are happy, it makes me as happy as I am!
Yes, I do. When our customers are happy, it makes me as happy as I am!
If you're still struggling, just quit.
It's not good to worry too much.
I heard from a patient that a nice restaurant just opened.
You're wondering if you should start a new hobby.
What does your teacher do for relaxation?
That candy was sold in seasonal flavors!
I hope you get out of the hospital and enjoy your hobbies to the fullest.
Do you often receive sweets at your business locations?
When I get stressed out, I end up making unnecessary purchases...
Oh, I heard that too. I'll try to go there next time.
I think it's a good thing. I hope you find a hobby you enjoy.
Me? I do a lot of light stretching, it helps me feel better. You should try it too.
Is it me? I do light stretching because it refreshes me. If you want, you can try it too.
Is it true? Thanks for letting me know.
Yes, sir. I would like to move my body without a care in the world.
Yes, I am. I would like to move my body without a care in the world.
I am happy to say that I often receive tea cakes. So if I'm not careful, I can easily gain weight!
I'm happy to say that I get a lot of tea breaks. So if I'm not careful, I can easily gain weight...
Oh, I know what you mean. I do that a lot too. But you wanted it, so you don't have to worry about it.
I understand because I have been there. But I am sure I wanted it at the time, and I don't regret it!
Did you see the animal video that was all over social media? They were so cute!
If I get a decent amount of time off, I want to travel far away.
I've been reading less and less lately and I was wondering if you could recommend any books for me to read at?
Do you prefer spicy or sweet?
Are you bored during your hospital stay?
How do you choose the snacks you offer?
How do you relieve your stress?
Is it that video? I saw it too. It's really soothing, isn't it? I naturally smiled... Hehe!
That's nice. It kind of makes me want to travel too!
Well, I haven't had a chance to read any entertainment books either... Sorry, but I don't have any to recommend.
I haven't had the opportunity to read any entertainment books either... Sorry, but I don't have any to recommend!
Honestly, I like anything as long as it tastes good.
Well... To be honest, I like anything as long as it tastes good!
I have my phone, so I'm never bored!
I had my phone so I wasn't bored.
We prepare items that have been well received by our customers based on their reactions. And then there are the trendy ones.
We have prepared items that have been well received by our customers based on their reactions. And then there are the trendy ones.
Drink and smoke and you'll forget.
Drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes... That way you can forget about the bad things!
I enjoyed the movie I saw the other night. I was fascinated by the actors' good performances.
The cafe there seems to have a menu that they serve only to their regulars.
Do you like to watch sports?
Do you often play games on your phone?
Is there anything you would like to do when you leave the hospital?
Oh, by the way, you can now purchase sweets from that popular store online!
Do you still like to drink?
I'm a little curious. I'll watch it sometime.
I didn't know they had such a menu.
I don't know much about it. It's not that I don't like...
I don't know much about it. It's not that I don't like them, but...
Yeah, I do that a lot. It's just a good way to pass the time.
Yes, I'm doing it. It's just a good way to pass the time.
There are so many things to do... I'm having a hard time deciding what to start with.
There are so many things to do... I'm not sure where to start.
Is that so? Thank you very much. I'll buy it next time.
What's the big deal? I can't live without booze.
Naturally. I can't live without alcohol... Hehe!
Yes, I do. Without alcohol, I can't live...
Would you like to have dinner at a restaurant?
I'll join you.
A little inconvenient... Sorry.
If it's okay with me, I'll go out with you.
It's just not a good time... Really sorry.
Great, I'll gladly go with you.
Sorry, this isn't a good time.
Yes, I will go with you.

Thank you for the invitation. I'll be happy to go along.
Sorry... I would be grateful if you would invite me back!
Thanks for the offer. I'll go out with you.
I'm sorry, can we do this another time?
Sorry... I'd be happy to be invited back.
It sounds like fun, so I'll keep you company.
Sorry... Please invite me back.
I'm sorry, if you could do it another time...
Would you like to have tea at a cafe?
Why don't you take a break at a cafe?
Why don't you go to the park for a while?
Why don't you relax in the park?
Could you please come this way now?
I need you to come over here... Is it okay now?
Please come with care.
Seems like the timing wasn't right...
I just wanted to ask you a few questions...
Excuse me, I need to check something...
I'm meeting with you now, is that okay?
I'm glad. I'll be on my way soon.
How are you feeling? If you need anything, please let me know right away.
No problem. Nothing special.
It's okay. No particular problem.
Are you feeling better?

What is it?
Well, sorry about that...
Can I help you?
What is it?
Yes?
It's okay.
I'm sorry... I can't go out with you.
I'm... Sorry...
I'm sorry, but I have to decline.
Excuse me.
Do you... Have a moment?
Well... I'm afraid I must decline.
No problem.
... I'm sorry, I can't go out with you.
I have my reasons.
Not at all.
Excuse me.
Why don't we have a little chat now?
Okay, I'll be happy to go out with you.
Sorry, I can't keep you company for a moment.
Uh, yes. I'll go out with you.
I'm not in the mood for that... Sorry.
Okay, let's go out.
Sorry, I'll pass.
Sorry, I'm a bit out of my depth with all the chatter...
Yeah, okay.

Sorry, I can't go.
Yes... I will keep you company...
That's a bit... Out of the question...

Okay, let's go together.
Uh... No, thank you.
I'll go out with you.
Uh... Sorry.

We decline your request.
... Would you mind following me to the restroom?
Hyah!

I hope you take care of yourself.
Are you sleeping properly at night?
Isn't it hard to work in sales?

What are you talking about? With your current ability, a handshake session is the best you can do.
I understand your desire to be selfish, but shaking hands is also an admirable job. Please do your best.
I'm surprised you noticed. The building itself is a bit dated, but they have a nice selection of microphones and speakers.
How did you notice that? The building itself is a bit dated, but we have good microphones and speakers for that!
I will definitely go! And I'll be there whether I have to work or not!
I will go to the show no matter what.
I think it's good to think of different ways to sell! And there are actually girls who are starting to.
I think it's good to think of different ways to sell. There are actually girls who are starting to.
I don't care what you say... Do what you want.
... I can't give you any advice if you ask me.
I've thought of a way to partition the lyrics.
Me too... I'd love to be on TV someday.
Regarding the new song... Has there been any progress since then?
Isn't it difficult to manage a building?
I'd like to use this as a reference... Any goodies you'd like to see?
Of course I love being on stage, but I have a yearning to be in the... Media!
I wonder... How long I can be an idol...
Thanks for the help. I'll practice with this.
... I think it's good that you have high goals.
Oh? New song? I'm working on it, so just be patient. Creative work takes time.
Is it a new song? We are working on it. Creative work takes time, so please wait!
I basically let the management company take care of it, so it's not that hard for me personally.
Basically, the management company takes care of it, so it's not that hard for me.
Well... If there were key chains... That would be great... I would definitely buy a lot of them...
Hmmm... I think I would be happy with a keychain. I'd like to put a lot of them on my painbucks.
There are girls who are in the media even as underground idols, and I think that if you work hard, your dreams will come true!
There are girls who have appeared in the media even as underground idols, and I think that if you work hard, your dreams will come true.
You don't get to decide that for yourself, not for others. Don't ask me.
I think that is for you to decide. I can't answer that question.
The group I performed with the other night had a new song out, and it was very good!
I'm thinking of studying comedy to enhance my live MCing... What do you think?
Do you have, um... Hobbies?
Do you have a live music club because you love music?
Thank you for always leaving comments on my blog!
What did you do on your last day off?
I'd like to spend more money on my hobbies, but that's just not possible...
I heard it too, it's a great song. I would love to sing a song like that.
I don't think you're suited for this. I think your fans would be more pleased if you honed your skills as a regular idol.
If I had to guess, I'd say alcohol.
Hobbies... If I had to pick one, I'd say drinking.
That's right. I don't sing or play, though. I like to listen as a guest.
That's right. But I don't sing or play. I like to listen as a guest.
I'm so glad you're watching...
I'm so glad you saw it.
I was walking around eating at various restaurants. Well, it was like half the job because I was also looking for a place to entertain guests.
I ate at many different restaurants. Well, it was like a job because I was also looking for a place to entertain my guests.
Then quit being an idol and work hard. You'll make more money that way.
I think you'll just have to put up with it as it is, or try to get a part-time job or something.
I love the dance of that idol group so much that I practice it at home.
I often get likes on social networking sites, do you have any tips?
I've had pancakes from a famous restaurant and they were so good!
I'm going to stay at a friend's house.
By the way, you were interested in the sweets I recommended, did you try them?
Is it because you still love music that you are doing what you are doing now?
... I realize how hard it is to turn a hobby into a job!
Me too. It's fun to dance, isn't it?
You should write something that you can relate to.
I see. And did you put it on social media? It doesn't matter if you reported it to me.
That's good to hear. Did you put that picture on social media properly? Please tell your fans about it.
That's great. I hope you have a lot of fun.
That's great. Have lots of fun!
I tried it... And like I said, it was delicious...
I tried it. It was so good, I've bought it several times since then!
That's right~. I used to be in a band. Well, I couldn't make my debut because I wasn't very good at it.
That's right. I used to be in a band. But I wasn't very good at it, so it was a dream come true to make my debut.
I don't know what your problem is. Well, it's your choice, so go for it.
I don't know what your problem is. I can only support you irresponsibly.
I was able to make delicious pastries, and when I posted them on social media, I received more responses than usual.
What do you think is an idol-like hobby?
You know... I have a thing for sparkly stage costumes.
I won tickets to my favorite idol's concert!
What sparked your interest in live idol shows?
Why do famous artists record abroad?
I tried the cup noodles you recommended before and they were delicious!
That would be great. It's a chance for more than just our fans to get to know us!
... If you ask me, I don't really know. It's a job to sell dreams, and I think you should just play the pretty girl appropriately.
You've got to polish your performance before you start pining for a costume.
You can admire the costumes, but you have to polish your stage performance!
Oh, congratulations! I hope the gig will be an inspiration for you!
Congratulations! I hope the gig will be an inspiration to you.
At first... Well, my friend invited me... And then I started having fun... And I've been coming here ever since.
I was invited by a friend. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the live show and was completely hooked after just one visit!
Hmmm... Everyone has their own reasons! Why don't you just ask the artist who actually recorded it?
... I'm sure artists have answered this question in magazine interviews, etc., so please look for it!
Right? Now try adding raayu (Chinese chili oil) It'll be even better.
That's good to know. Now try adding some raayu, it will be even better!
Sorry... Maybe next time.
Great, let's go together.
I'm sorry... I can't.
Good. I'll go out with you.
I ain't going.
Sorry, I can't go out with you.
Yes, yes... I'll go with you.
I'm sorry, I can't go.
Great, great, I'll go out with you~!
Uh... Sorry.
Would you like to have dinner at a restaurant?
Thank you for the wonderful invitation. I'll be with you.
A little inconvenient... My apologies.
Okay, I'll go out with you.
Sorry, I can't come with you.
Well, I'll go out with you.
Maybe some other time.
Sure. Why don't you come with me?
I'll have to decline this time.
Thank you for the offer... Thank you very much... I'll go out with you.
Um, sorry...
Okay, I'll go out with you.
I'd love to go, but... Sorry~!
If you want, why don't we go to a cafe?
Why don't you two go to the park?
Would you like to take a break in the park?
Could you please come now?
Excuse me, I need you to come over here.
Thank you very much. Take care.
Excuse me, I was wondering if I could ask you...
I'd like to talk to you about a few things...
I would like to talk to you outside, is your time okay?
Thank you very much. I'll be on my way as soon as I can.
... You're busy, I understand.
Uh, yes. Can I help you?
You wanted to see me?
Is something wrong?
What's wrong?
Hmmm, what's wrong?
May I have a moment?
Yes, what is it?
What's going on?
What is it?
Yes... What is it?
Oh, what's up?
Is your time... Okay?
Um... Sorry.
... I'm sorry, I can't go out with you.
Sorry, but I have to decline.
Ha, yes... It's okay, it's okay...
I'm sorry...
Okay, okay~.
I'm sorry, but I can't.
... I can't socialize with you.
Sorry, I can't keep you company.
I don't care.
I can't go out with you.
Maybe a little too much.
Uh... Yes, okay...
I'm... Sorry...
Not at all!
Sorry~!
If you like, we can talk about it slowly.
All right. I'll chat with you.
Well... Maybe we can talk about this some other time...
All right. Tell us a story.
I'm not really in the mood to talk... Sorry, but I have to decline.
Well, I don't mind.
I'm not going to get into a long conversation.
Sorry, but I'd appreciate it if we could talk some other time.
Uh, yes... We'll go out with you...
I'm not very good at talking... Sorry...
Okay, I'm totally with you.
Sorry, but I'm just not in the mood for this!
I'd like to chat with you a lot.
... Yes, I'll go out with you.
No... We can't socialize.
... Well, I don't mind.
No... I decline.
Well, I'll go out with you this time.
I'm not going out with you.
I'm going to have to turn that down.
Uh... Yes, I'm fine...
That's just... Sorry...
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
I can't go out with you.
Would you like to go to a hotel with me?
I understand. I'll join you.
That's... Sorry.
... Okay, I'll go out with you.
I'll pass.
Great. Let's go out.
I ain't in the mood.
I'll take you up on that offer.
I don't think I can go out with you for a while.
I understand... I'll go out with you...
I'm sorry...
Great, I'll go out with you!
No, I'm not going!
Would you like to go to the restroom with me?
I wish you would consider timing...
I'm not in a position to be in a relationship.
Are you nuts? I'm not going out with you.
Whoa!
I can't go out with you...
No, no, no... Not now.
Would you like to join us for a few minutes?
May I have a moment of your time?
Excuse me... Could you please come to the restroom?
I'm glad you're coming.
Can't you relax your shoulders a little more?
Wouldn't you like the choreography to be easier?
Excuse me, could you tell me what your schedule is for next week?
Is it profitable to be a live music club owner?
Did you buy a lot of my goods?
Would you be willing to sell my CDs on a national scale?
I didn't expect it to be an easy sell... But it's hard to bear the loss of popularity when it continues to be unpopular.
Was it too much force? Thank you. I'll be careful.
I understand very well. Honestly, learning the choreography is the most tedious part!
I thought I told you properly the other day. How could you forget?
I believe I contacted you properly the other day. Please take good notes.
To be honest, I don't make that much money. It's almost like a hobby.
To be honest, we don't make that much money. I do it mostly as a hobby.
I'm buying a lot! I'll put it up on social media next time...
I buy a lot. I'll put it up on social media sometime.
Sorry, but that's not my job.
I'm sorry, but that's not my job...
If it's hard for you, quit. If you have the energy to continue, hang in there a little longer. That's all I can say.
If it's too hard for you, you can stop... If you still have the energy, try a little harder.
Egos are important, but not too much. Well, it's not for me to say, but...
Why would I write 'I'm going to change my guess' or anything else on the internet? Honestly, I don't want you to say anything.
I have a mental health problem and would like to have a well-rounded vacation.
I too would like to have a property and disposable income in the future...
Please refrain from doing violent wotagei, okay? It's annoying and makes you stand out more than me.
Is there a quick way to become popular?
I don't know what I can do if I graduate from being an idol... It's no use writing on my resume that I used to be an idol.
I know, I know, but I just can't stop looking at it... I'll try to limit the frequency.
There is no need to write every single thing. It's annoying for the person being promoted.
That's no good. You can't change the schedule you set.
That is not allowed. The schedule you set up must be changed, or others will be inconvenienced!
In case you haven't noticed, it's hard, you know? And if people don't show up, we don't make any money at all.
It's not easy, you know? If people don't show up, we don't make any money at all.
Wow, I know... I would never do that...
It's okay. We would never do such a nuisance.
If there was such a thing, everyone would be a star.
That's... Not true. With such a method, anyone can become popular.
I don't mind, do you? You can write "former idol. It's a good way to get people's attention.
I don't mind if you write that you are a former idol. I'm sure there are some who would be interested.
Is there an easy way to become a better singer?
It looks like a member of that group is quitting.
I'm getting tired of all the cover songs, so I'd like to hear some new ones if possible.
Why do live houses charge for drinks in addition to the ticket price?
Sales of goods directly contribute to my salary, so please keep buying!
What is the difference between children who can become top idols and those who cannot? Is it talent?
When I first stood on stage, I was moved in my own way... But now I don't feel any emotion anymore.
I don't know... I guess the only way is steady effort.
Oh... I see. It's a shame, because we had a surprisingly good talk.
I get it. You just have to be prepared...
Understood. I'll have it ready for you. Please wait for me.
Good question. The short answer is, we're licensed to operate as a restaurant, so we have to serve drinks.
Good question. The short answer is that I'm licensed to operate as a restaurant, so I have to serve drinks.
I will continue to... Buy many, many more... I will... Support you...
I will continue to buy many more and support them.
Having talent is a prerequisite! I guess the big difference is how much effort you can put in on top of that. Good luck to you too!
Having talent is a prerequisite. The difference is how much effort you put in. Please do your best!
Well, isn't it like that when you get used to anything? Don't worry too much about it.
I think whatever you do will become the norm once you get used to it. You don't need to worry that much about it.
I listened to the song you recommended before. To be honest, it was not my taste in the genre, but it wasn't bad!
Where did you take the pictures of the scenery you posted on your blog? I'd like to visit there too!
What do you enjoy about being an idol manager?
I decided to try something that was more like an idol, so I started baking sweets, and surprisingly, it was a lot of fun and I got hooked on it.
Do you have any hobbies other than coming to see your idols perform live?
After visiting a cat café with friends, the desire to work there grew...
If you have any good stress relievers, I'd love to hear about them!
Really? Then I'll come back to tell you if I have any more song recommendations.
It's a popular spot for taking emo photos. I'll show you around next time.
What's fun... Is watching you grow up.
What do you enjoy... Seeing you grow?
That's a good thing. I'm not much of a cook, so I admire you for being able to make sweets.
That's good to know. I can't cook at all, so I respect that.
Well... Anime and manga... Are my favorites...
If it's not live music, I like anime and manga.
Maybe you could get a part-time job. As long as you can balance it with being an idol.
If you can balance your idol work with a part-time job, I think you can do it.
A batting center is a good idea. You should go there too.
The batting center is nice. It feels good, so go for it!
I envy you for being able to learn the choreography so quickly. Perhaps you have been learning dance for a while?
Why is popcorn at the movie theater so delicious?
Lately I've been listening only to ani-songs for the cover songs I sing live...
I have the image that you always eat expensive food, but how is it really?
... You're acting suspiciously, you should fix that, right?
So, job-wise, you get to listen to all the live music you want for free? I envy you!
Do you have a thrill to play with?
No, not particularly... I just always liked to imitate idols and used to dance a lot.
Is it the atmosphere of the place? I'm not sure, but it sure tastes better than usual!
That's a good thing. Keep adding more and more variations to your songs.
You voluntarily increased the variety of your songs. You are very motivated.
Hehe... It's pretty much as I imagined. Having good food is one of my favorite things to do.
I think it's pretty much as I imagined. Receiving good food is one of my pleasures, so...
I'll make an effort...
Ugh... I'll try my best to fix it.
I can't go to every concert, you know? Even if I did, I'd be working all the time. Huh...
I can't go to every gig, you know? Even if I did, I'd be working all the time... Haha!
That's gambling at its best.
It is gambling, after all. Enjoy the thrilling moments!
Have you seen this month's issue of that fashion magazine? The clothes featured in the magazine were designed to look good on you!
All I do these days is window shopping... If I had the money, I could buy all of this and that.
I am open to any and all recommendations. I'm having a little trouble finding material for my blog.
Do you read comic books or something?
You went to a ramen shop yesterday, right? Was it good?
Oh... It smells so good. Lovely perfume.
Why do adults drink alcohol?
Really? If it suits me, I'll buy it... Oh, but it's rather pricey...
I've been putting up with a lot too... Haha, I wonder when we will be able to live a money free life!
Do something on your own. Don't ask me.
That's your job, too. Do something about it on your own.
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm not very familiar with it. I don't think I'll be able to keep up with that topic.
I don't read much. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to keep up with that topic.
Oh... I'm so glad you saw my social networking site... The ramen was delicious...
I'm glad you saw me on social media. The ramen there was delicious, so you can go there if you want!
Oh, you know how good this is~? I'm so glad you like it!
I'm glad I like this perfume. I usually don't get noticed by people...
Of course it's because it's good. Also... Sometimes I can't do without a drink.
Because it's delicious. Oh, and sometimes I just need to get drunk.
Would you like to go to a restaurant if you like?
Would you like to walk with me to the restaurant?
Would you like to have tea at a cafe?
Why don't you two go to a cafe?
Can you come over now?
Thank you. Thank you very much.
... Okay, I understand.
Excuse me, could you please come this way?
... I'm sorry to hear that, but it can't be helped.
Hi, thanks for your help.
Can I talk to you for a moment?
Can we meet outside now?
Are you sure? Then I'm on my way.
May I have a word?
... Um, sorry.
... Do you have a moment?
Is... Now okay?
If you like, we can have a little chat.
I have a lot to talk about, would you mind keeping me company?
Would you like to go with me... To the hotel?
Why don't you stay at a hotel... And relax?
Why don't you and I... Go to the bathroom?
Would you like to go... To the bathroom with me?
Can I ask you for a favor?
Would you mind... Accompanying me for a moment?
... Could you please come to the restroom? I'm trying to have some fun.
I see that you can keep up with us, thank you very much.
I'd like to hone my performance skills more.
Don't get too passionate about the game, okay? We are entertainers.
Which games are you good at?
If you are not busy, would you be willing to play with me? I am sure you will be satisfied.
Thank you for playing in our casino!
Would you be willing to play with me once in a while for a break?
I haven't received many tips lately...
I think it is very good that you have ambition. I can't be outdone either.
Yes, I know. We always try to make sure that our customers enjoy our services!
I'm rather confident in my poker skills.
Well... Yeah. Maybe we can play just to see what you can do.
Well... It might not be a bad idea to play with it once in a while, just to see how good you are.
No, no, thank you for always entertaining me.
No, it's always been a pleasure for me, and I thank you for that!
I'm here for work, after all... So I can't play often.
Some people are so stingy. I'd give it to them with a bang.
Let's see... Maybe all the thrifty people came. One of these days, there will be someone wealthy.
Conversation with customers is also a part of my job... I have to take good care of my speaking skills.
Are you a regular slot player... Losing a lot of money?
I'm sure you know that... But cheating is strictly forbidden, okay?
Is it time to bring in a new slot machine so we can have a new slot machine in stock? 
Please follow the rules and have fun at the casino!
You have the opportunity to talk to people from a variety of companies, so your talk skills are important in this job.
Should I move to a bigger casino now?
I think you are right. I'd like to improve my speaking skills too.
Oh, it's that customer... I'm worried about him, but I can't interrupt him...
I am well aware of that. I have no desire to cheat in front of that manager.
I am very much aware of that. I have no desire to cheat in front of that manager, but...
Maybe a new machine will attract more customers... Let's consider it.
Maybe a new unit would attract more customers... I'll have to consider it.
Yes, I know exactly what you mean.
Yes, I am very much aware of that.
No, not as much as the dealers.
I don't know. If you're not happy, why don't you just quit early?
I don't know all the details... But if you're not happy, I suggest you quit as soon as possible.
Am I dressed neatly? I always dressed neatly because I didn't want to be disrespectful to my customers.
Isn't it always thrilling to play the game?
I heard a rumor that an international celebrity will be visiting us soon... Is it true?
When a drunken customer was eager to break the slot, even I was impatient.
Are you dissatisfied with our service?
I wish you the best of luck with your sales.
Sometimes I want to compete purely for the sake of competing, not for the sake of entertaining customers.
It's okay. No problem.
Yes, I think so. There is a sense of tension that comes from the fact that both sides are serious about the competition.
Is that so? If you know the manager... You'll have to be even more enthusiastic than usual that day.
It is part of your job to deal with such people. You should be able to deal with them calmly.
It's part of our job to deal with such customers... So please do your best to handle them calmly next time.
I have no complaints.
No particular complaints.
Haha, thank you very much. I feel like I'm getting lucky.
Thank you very much. I feel like I'm getting lucky.
That's good, isn't it? At least I think it's more flammable.
I think it would be good if it was accidental. As for me, I think it would be more exciting and
Does hot yoga really work? For me, it seems no different than regular yoga...
I got a little excited and bought some expensive sparkling wine.
Do you cook for yourself?
Does the manager have any pets?
Do you like horse racing, etc.?
Bankers have an image of being busy, but do you have time for hobbies?
What is your favorite casino game?
What do you think? I don't know the details.
That sounds great. I look forward to the day you open the bottle.
Yes, I do it without fail. I like cooking a lot.
I used to have some, but I don't think I have any now.
We used to keep them, but we don't keep anything now!
Yes, I like it. Basically, I like all betting.
Yes, I like it. Basically, I like all betting.
If it's not the busy season, there is more leeway than you might think, so you should be fine.
Slots, of course. Someday I'm going to win the big bucks, so be prepared.
Naturally, it's slots. It's the best because you can dream of winning.
I've recently been thinking about buying a record player.
Do you ever play poker games as a hobby rather than for work?
What do you usually do on your days off?
I'm looking for a good drink, any suggestions?
What do you spend the money you get from winning the game?
Do you have the opportunity to travel?
Apart from playing in the casino, what else do you like to do?
Actually, so have I. I've been looking for... For a variety of things, but I can't seem to find a favorite!
I got into this job because I love it, of course. I often hang out with my friends.
I often play at dart bars. I like to play darts.
Old vintage wine. Older doesn't always mean better, so find out in advance what the winning year is.
Old vintage wine. But older does not always mean better, so be sure to research the right year!
Most of the time you're eating expensive meat. Combined with the winning spices, it's really delicious.
Most of the time we eat expensive meat. Combined with the winning spices, it's really delicious!
We always need to take a long vacation once a year, so we travel then and there!
Booze and cigarettes.
Alcohol and cigarettes.
I read his autobiography the other day and found it very informative. I hope you will read it too.
I enjoy collecting antique goods.
My friend likes to have parties and often throws them... I'm always worried about what to bring as a gift!
Where are you going on vacation this year?
It's funny that I should say this, but... Don't get too carried away with your betting, okay?
Do you watch foreign dramas?
You seem to drink a lot. Which drink do you like best?
Sounds very interesting. I'll have to read it when I get a chance.
It's nice, antiques. It has a nostalgic and somehow warm atmosphere, I like it too!
A little nibble might be enough.
I haven't narrowed down my choices yet... Might be a good idea to take it easy in Japan.
I haven't narrowed down the candidates yet... Maybe it would be better to relax in Japan instead of going abroad this time!
I think I'm trying to be moderate... But I'll be more careful.
I think I'm trying to be moderate... But I'll be more careful.
I do watch it. I'm just not good at watching them for relaxation, so I have an accumulation of unwatched dramas...
I like everything... But if I had to pick one, I'd have to say tequila.
I like everything... But if I had to pick one, I'd say tequila.
If you would like, we can go to the restaurant.
Sorry, I must decline...
Thank you for the invitation. I will be happy to accompany you.
All right. Let's go out.
If you're going to go, go alone.
Great. Let's go.
I'm sorry, it's just not a good time.
Yes, I will go with you.
I'm sorry... I'm afraid I must decline this time.
Would you like to have dinner at a restaurant?
If it's okay with me, I'll go out with you.
I'm sorry, but I can't go out with you at...
I'll go out with you if it's okay with me.
Great, I'll go out with you.
I am sorry, but I must decline.
I see no reason to refuse your invitation.
I'm not going out with you.
I'd be happy to go with you.
I'm sorry... I'd be happy to invite you back some other time.
I will be happy to join you.
I'm a little inconvenienced... Sorry.
If you like, we can have tea at a cafe.
Would you like to go to the cafe with us?
Why don't you spend some time in the park?
I feel like talking to you in the park... How about it?
Excuse me, could you please come this way?
... I understand. I'm sorry, but I don't have a choice.
I'd like to ask you to come over for a minute...
I see that you are coming. We are waiting for you.
So it's hard to do right away... I understand.
Thank you for all your help.
I'd like to ask you a few questions...
Thank you very much. I'll be on my way.
I would like to borrow some money...
I understand. I'll lend it to you.
I am sorry, but I must decline.
What's wrong?
Yes, how can I help you?
Can I help you?
Can I help you?
You wanted to see me?
Oh, is that me?
Can I help you?
Now, will it be okay?

I don't care.
Not now.
I'm sorry... It's just... It's not a good time.
I am sorry, but we cannot accept your request.
Is your time okay?
I am sorry, but we cannot accept your request.
I'm afraid I have to decline.
I don't have time for this.
Not a problem at all.
I'm just... Sorry.
No problem. 
If you like, we can take the time to talk.
No problem. We'll go out with you.
I'm not in the mood... Sorry.
I'd be happy to go out with you.
I am sorry, but if you could reschedule the timing...
Yeah, no problem.
I'm sorry, but if we could talk about this another time...
I'm not in the mood.
I'm sorry, I'm kind of in the middle of...
I'm sorry, but right now I'm a little...
I would like to talk with you a lot.
Well... Why don't we go to a hotel?
... Yeah, it's okay.
I am sorry, but I must decline.
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you company.
... Okay. Let's go out.
Refuse
... I understand. All right.
Well... I'm afraid I must decline.
I understand.
How about a little rest at the hotel?
I understand... I'll go out with you.
... Yes, that's fine.
Uh... Sorry about that.
I understand. Let's go out with you.
You can go out with me, but don't... Bore me.
What are you talking about? I'm not going out with you.
I'll go out with you if it's okay with me.
No, no, no... No, I refuse.
... To keep you company.
I am sorry. I am unable to associate with you.
Would you like to go to the bathroom with me?
Now I'm a little...
As I said, I can't do it now...
I can't socialize with you right now...
Huh... Think about timing.
No, no, no, no, no... I can't do that right now...
Now I'm in trouble...
I would like to ask you a few questions...
May I take a moment of your time?
Can you come to the bathroom? I'd like to have some fun with you.
I'm sorry, but I understand...
Are you okay now? I mean, I'm not going to make it worse.
I got a lot of tips the other day.
After all, it makes us happy when our customers enjoy our products.
There was once a customer who won so many games in a row that the manager couldn't help but pull a face!
I have a slot machine that has been malfunctioning excessively... Shouldn't I replace it?
Do you ever make a wish before a game?
Would you like to try your luck and play a game with me? If you beat me, we might have a good business meeting, right?
I just need a little more... Paycheck...
I have to thank my customers.
Yes, I am. I intend to hone my skills more and more so that I can please you even more!
Really? I wish I could have been there...
... Is it wiser to deal with the hassle before it happens? Let's not be stingy and buy new ones.
Well... We'll replace it before it happens.
You visit power spots. Luck is important.
I do visit power spots. Because luck is important.
That's a horrible way to lose... Sorry, but I'm afraid I'll have to pass.
If you want money, you should get rich playing slots too.
If you want money, you should try to get rich at the slots!
I have heard that in the past it was possible to drop the ball on a target number, is this true?
If you're not careful, you can get carried away with the game.
What made you decide to become a dealer?
Our guests loved the interior of the casino!
What games would you like to see in a casino?
You always seem to be busy.
There is always a lot of pressure on me because I can never make a mistake in front of a customer...
I've heard that you could have done it if you honed your skills due to the construction of the wheel, but I don't know... The details.
Me too. When I first became a dealer, I used to get angry a lot!
As is often the case, I still like to gamble!
Kuk... Of course, right? I designed it myself.
I came up with the idea, and I'm happy to receive compliments from my customers!
Hmmm... Personally, I think it would be fun to play hanafuda (Japanese playing cards) or something like that...
Well... Personally, I think it would be fun if we could play Hanafuda or something like that.
I am sorry for causing you concern. I am still a strong person, so there is no problem.
Well, that's the way it is. You know, every job has pressure, and you're not the only one who has a hard time.
I don't think that's an option. There is pressure in every job, so do your best to bounce back!
As usual... It's a little more bearable when a customer yells at you after a big loss.
Don't you get nervous when a customer bets a large sum of money?
Oh, and by the way, I think the stock of playing cards is running low...
Are there any plans to build a new casino?
I am always happy to accept a match, so please feel free to contact me!
Like us dealers, your calculations are very important, aren't they?
I got this job because I love it... But lately I've been thinking that maybe I would have been better off just being a customer...
I understand exactly how you feel... We just have to let it go.
I know exactly what you mean. I always try so hard not to show my nervousness.
I have informed the manager, so you should be fine.
I haven't thought about it at the moment. If I were to make a new one, it would be when I get a flash of an idea.
I don't think we have any ideas at the moment. I don't have any ideas for new casinos.
Let me challenge you when your luck comes your way.
Calculations are important... Sometimes I break out in a cold sweat when I can't make ends meet!
If you feel like quitting, quit. It's better than hating something you loved.
I think it is better to quit before you start hating something you liked. Personally, I agree.
Since I bought the pressure cooker, I enjoy cooking more and more!
I would like to travel abroad, but my schedule doesn't work out with my friends...
I went to an owl cafe with a friend and it was really powerful to see them up close!
A friend of mine started organizing things and threw away most of what he had in his collection!
How long have you been playing in the casino?
I was once invited to go skydiving, but my fear got the better of me and I refused.
What is the difference between a regular cigarette and a cigar?
That is wonderful. It looks like it could be used in many different recipes and I would love to purchase some!
I understand... We can get together for lunch or dinner quickly, but traveling is difficult.
An owl, interesting. I would love to visit there too!
Uh... You mean the minimalist thing? I don't deny it, but that's a behavior I just don't get.
I don't mean to be negative but... This is behavior I just don't understand.
Influenced by a family member who was a gambler, I started playing as soon as I grew up.
I started playing as soon as I grew up, partly due to the influence of a family member who was a gambler.
Even though we know that accidents rarely happen, we still cower!
Cigars don't let smoke into your lungs. That's the biggest difference.
Cigars don't let smoke into your lungs. I guess that's the main difference.
I like to run while listening to music.
I've been loving ordering sweets lately.
Have you always had a hobby?
Does the manager also watch dramas?
What is your favorite alcoholic beverage?
Do you like chess? In spite of appearances, I'm good at it.
Do you like to watch sports?
Me too. I feel so refreshed while running!
Then there is a store that carries delicious Daifuku fruit. Please try ordering from us!
All my life... I've loved reading since I was a little girl.
Drama? I haven't seen one in a long time.
Drama... Haven't seen it in a long time.
I like anything as long as it's high in frequency.
I like anything with a high alcohol content.
I have no experience playing... But I would like to try it if I have the chance.
I don't hate it. Watching sports over drinks is good entertainment.
I like it. Cheering them on over drinks puts me in a good mood!
Is there anything you are into these days?
Have you ever been to an art museum? You will be impressed when you touch a real work of art!
A customer recommended me a good restaurant that just opened at the next station.
Do you have many cars after all?
Have you ever been to a casino outside of your country to play?
When I look at mail order sites, I end up buying all sorts of things!
Do you drink only alcoholic beverages with high alcohol content?
Is it smoothies? I make them at home a lot.
I have been there several times to see the paintings in the company of friends who love them!
I went there. The gibier dishes were especially good, so please order them!
Oh, yeah. I'm especially fond of muscle cars... And in my spare time I like to look at my collection.
Yes, I do. I especially like muscle cars and look at my collection in my spare time!
Yes, I've been there. I had fun everywhere, but I didn't win... At all!
Yes, I've been there. I had fun everywhere... But I didn't win at all!
The Internet is full of temptations, so I think I understand a little how you feel.
Are you worried about me? I don't drink enough to worry about that.
I don't drink that much, so I'm not worried about it.
If you like, we can have dinner at the restaurant.
Would you like to go to that... Restaurant with me?
Um, would you like to have a cup of tea at a cafe?
If you would like to join us, why don't you go to the café with us?
Would you like to talk in the park?
If you like, why don't you spend some time in the park?
If your time is okay, could you please come here?
Are you sure? Then, I'll be waiting for you.
Could you please come here now?
I understand... No, please don't worry about it.
Thank you for all your help!
Excuse me, I have to ask...
I'd like to talk to you outside now...
Thank you very much. Well, I'll see you later.
Can you lend me some money?
Are you okay now?
Will you please stay with me and talk about my story?
We have a lot to talk about... Would you like to join us?
Well... If you don't mind, why don't we go to a hotel?
Would you like to take a... Break at the hotel?
Um... Would you like to go to the bathroom with me?
If you like, you can go to... To the restroom.
Would you like to join us for a few minutes?
I have a favor to ask...
Could you please come to the bathroom? I... Want to have some fun.
Ah... You are not in the mood for that...
Do you have a minute? I won't do anything wrong, so...
I wish I had a lot of spending money...
You're always working, great job! Thanks for all your hard work!
Oh, yeah, you want to play Shiritori?
Don't be selfish... If you really want money, get a real job.
It's not good to be selfish! If you really want money, work diligently.
Haha... Thank you. It's kind of embarrassing to be praised for something so obvious...
Thank you. I'm glad you appreciate the compliment!
What's so funny about that... I'm not going out with you.
Are you trying to pass the time with me? I'm not going out with you.
Huh... Cleaning is troublesome... I don't want to do it
Is the new juice in stock?
Are you working properly?
Don't make me do it just because it's a hassle, okay? You clean up after yourself.
Don't force me to do it just because it's a hassle, okay? Make sure you clean up after yourself.
Yes, we have them in stock! Just place your order and we'll get it to you right away!
Yeah, it's in stock! If you buy it, I'll see if I can get it to you right away.
... Looking for unemployed friends? I'm sorry, but I'm not one of your kind.
... Looking for a fellow unemployed person? I'm sorry, but I'm not one of your kind.
After all, home is the most comfortable place...
Do you enjoy working diligently? Isn't it hard work, carrying heavy loads?
... Sometimes, I wonder if it's okay to keep doing what I'm doing...
I know how you feel... But you stay home too much
I know exactly how you feel... But in your case, you're home too much.
It's fun! Yes, it's hard work, but I like to move my body, so it's not hard for me.
